üõ∞Ô∏è Landsat False Color Composite Generation
Dual Approach: Local Processing & Google Earth Engine API

This repository presents two distinct approaches for generating False Color Composite (FCC) images from Landsat satellite data. One method leverages locally stored Landsat imagery, processing it directly using Python libraries, while the other demonstrates the power and efficiency of fetching and processing Landsat data via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. Both notebooks are designed for educational purposes, illustrating fundamental concepts in remote sensing and geospatial data handling.
‚ú® Overview

False Color Composites are invaluable in remote sensing for highlighting specific features on the Earth's surface that are not readily visible in true color. By assigning non-visible bands (like Near-Infrared) to visible color channels (like Red), FCCs can effectively differentiate between vegetation health, water bodies, urban areas, and bare soil. This project provides practical examples of how to generate these composites using two common workflows:

    Local Data Processing (LandSAT_local(1).ipynb): Ideal for working with pre-downloaded or smaller datasets, providing granular control over the processing steps.

    Google Earth Engine API (LandSAT_FCC(16_06_25).ipynb): Best suited for large-scale analysis, accessing vast amounts of satellite data on the fly without local storage constraints, and leveraging cloud computing power.

   LandSAT_local(1).ipynb Dependencies:

        rasterio: For reading and writing raster datasets (e.g., TIFF files).

        geopandas: For working with geospatial vector data (though primarily used for environment setup in the snippet, useful for further analysis).

        numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.

Data Acquisition

   Local Processing: Assumes pre-downloaded Landsat 8 Level 1TP (Tier 1) imagery, typically in .TIF format, with individual bands. The provided notebook expects them in a /content/ directory.

        Example data path structure: /content/LC08_L1TP_144054_20250124_20250130_02_T1_B*.TIF

   Google Earth Engine API: Data is streamed directly from the Landsat collection within the Google Earth Engine data catalog. No local download is required.

üöÄ Quick Start

To run these notebooks and generate your own Landsat FCCs, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

   For Local Processing: Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries (rasterio, geopandas, numpy, matplotlib). You will also need to download Landsat 8 imagery for your area of interest (e.g., from USGS EarthExplorer) and place the band files in a designated local directory.

  For GEE API: You need a Google Earth Engine account. Visit earthengine.google.com to sign up and get access. Ensure you have the earthengine-api and geemap libraries installed in your Python environment.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Landsat-FCC-Generation.git
cd Landsat-FCC-Generation

2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt # (You would create this file based on the dependencies listed above)

Alternatively, for the specific libraries used:

# For Local Processing Notebook
pip install rasterio geopandas matplotlib numpy

# For GEE API Notebook
pip install earthengine-api geemap

3. Run Jupyter Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook from the repository root:

jupyter notebook

This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface.

   For Local Processing: Open LandSAT_local(1).ipynb.

   Place your downloaded Landsat .TIF band files (B2, B3, B4, B5) into the /content/ directory (or update the file paths in the notebook to match your local setup).

   Run all cells sequentially.

   For GEE API: Open LandSAT_FCC(16_06_25).ipynb.

   Ensure your GEE authentication is set up (run ee.Authenticate() and ee.Initialize() if prompted or for first-time use).

   Run all cells sequentially. The interactive map will appear in the notebook output.

üéØ Applications

This work can be applied to various remote sensing and GIS tasks, including:

   Vegetation Health Monitoring: FCCs are excellent for assessing plant vigor and detecting changes over time.

   Land Use/Land Cover Mapping: Differentiating between various land cover types like forests, agricultural areas, urban sprawl, and water bodies.

   Environmental Monitoring: Tracking deforestation, urbanization, and disaster impacts.

   Agricultural Analysis: Monitoring crop growth stages, identifying stress, and yield prediction.

   Water Resource Management: Mapping water body extents and quality.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Considerations

Local Processing:

   Requires manual download and local storage of large satellite image files.

   Computationally intensive for very large areas or time series analysis, dependent on local hardware.

   Requires careful path management for individual band files.

Google Earth Engine API:

   Requires an internet connection and a GEE account.

   Steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with JavaScript/Python and GEE's API concepts.

   GEE's data access and processing capabilities are subject to its platform policies and rate limits.

   General: Image quality (cloud cover, atmospheric conditions) can significantly affect the clarity and interpretability of FCCs.

üîÆ Future Enhancements

   Interactive Band Selection: Implement widgets in the local processing notebook to allow users to dynamically select bands for FCC generation.

   Time Series Analysis: Extend both notebooks to allow for the generation of FCCs over a time series to observe changes.

   Cloud Masking: Incorporate more robust cloud masking techniques for cleaner imagery in both approaches.

   User Interface: Develop a simple web application using libraries like Streamlit or Flask to provide a more user-friendly interface for FCC generation without requiring direct code interaction.

   Comparison Tool: Add functionality to visually compare FCCs generated by both local and GEE methods.
